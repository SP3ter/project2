# Reversi
reversi is a famous game. But now you play it by using a python code!
Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board.
There are sixty-four identical game pieces called disks (often spelled "discs"), which are light on one side and dark on the other. Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's color
that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to
the current player's color.

The object of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled.

Reversi was most recently marketed by Mattel under the trademark Othello.

Each of the disks' two sides corresponds to one player; they are referred to here as light and dark after the sides of Othello pieces, but any counters with distinctive faces are suitable. The game may for example be played with a chessboard and Scrabble pieces, with one player letters and the other backs.
